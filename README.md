# Vu Overview

Vu is a Full Stack Group MVC Project that was assigned to Skill Distillery Cohort 7 in week 8 of the 16 week program. It is our second full web application and our first time using Spring MVC. We created Vu, a C.R.U.D. web application, to document a user's memories/experiences in a meaningful and organized way. You can view the application [here](http://www.contramonk.com:8080/Vu/)

# Project Requirements
Below are a list of features that were required of our group project. The scope of the project was not limited to, but had to contain these features.
Feature sets include:
+ A fully developed database schema. The database must be connected to your Java code using JPA.
+ C.R.U.D, manipulating objects and saving them in an appropriate database table.
+ A user log in, which is authenticated by a mySQL table. There should be different permission levels for the users, one admin that can add/update/delete content present on the site.
+ A correct implementation of a session object, this can be used to track a logged in user and any changes they make (for example, a shopping cart or favorites list).
+ A way to track an individual users previous experiences on the site.
